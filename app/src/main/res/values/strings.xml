    <string-array name="YM_Theory"><item>\t\tSearle\'s apparatus, two long steel wires of same length and diameter, a metre scale,
        a screw gauge, eight &#189; kg slotted weights and a 1 kg hanger.</item>
        <item>\t\tSearle\'s apparatus consists of two metal frames F1 and F2. Each frame has torsion
        head at the upper side and hook at the lower side. These frames are suspended from two wires AB and CD of same
        material, length and cross-section. The upper ends of the wires are screwed tightly in two torsion heads fixed
        in same rigid support.\n\t\t
A constant weight of 1 kilogram is suspended from the hook of the frame F2 attached to the auxiliary wire CD, which keeps
        the wire taut. A hanger H of 1 kilogram weight is suspended from the hook of the other frame F1. The
        experimental wire AB can be loaded by slipping slotted weights on the hanger.\n\t\t
A spirit level rests horizontally with its one end hinged in the frame F2. The other end of the spirit level rests
        on the tip of a spherometer screw fitted in the frame F1. The spherometer screw can be rotated up and down
        along a vertical pitch scale marked in millimetre. The two frames are kept together by cross bars E1 and
        E2.\n</item>
        <item>\t\tTo perform the experiment, kinks are removed from the wire AB by loading and unloading
        it two or three times. All the weights are then removed from the hanger. The wire AB is kept taut under the
        weight of the hanger alone.\n

    \t\tThe spherometer screw is then rotated till the bubble comes in the middle of the spirit level. The spherometer
        disc reading is recorded for zero load.
    A half kilogram weight is now slipped in the hanger. The wire AB extends and the frame F: moves down. The
        levelling is disturbed. The bubble is again brought in the middle by rotating the screw upwards. The distance
        by which screw is turned upwards gives the elongation of the wire due to half kilogram weight. A number of
        observations are taken by increasing the load on the hanger in steps of half kilogram each. The observations
        are then repeated by decreasing the load in the same order till all the weights are removed from the hanger.
        The mean of these observations is taken.\n

    \t\tA graph is plotted between load M and mean extension l. It is a straight line. From the graph, mean increase
        in length l for a load M kg is found.
    The measurements of length and radius of the wire are taken and value of Y is calculated from the relation,\n
    \t\tY = MgL/πr²l\t\tN/m².\n
    </item>
        <item>\t\tLet us suppose a wire of length L and radius r be loaded by a weight Mg and if l be
        the increase in length.\n
    Then, Normal stress = Mg/πr²\n
    and Longitudinal strain = l/L\n
    Hence, Young\'s modulus = Normal stress / Longitudinal strain\n
    or Y = (Mg/πr²)/(l/L)\n
    or Y = MgL/πr²l\n
    Knowing L and r, and finding l for known Mg, Y can be calculated.\n</item>
        <item>The following picture shows how Searle\'s Apparatus looks.</item>
        <item>1. Take two steel wires of same length and diameter and tight their ends in torsion
        screws A, B and C, D as shown in diagram. Wire AB becomes experimental wire and wire CD becomes auxiliary wire.
        \n\n2. Suspend a 1 kg dead load from hook of frame F2.\n\n3. Suspend a 1 kg hanger and eight 1/2 kg slotted
        weights from hook of frame F1. The experimental wire becomes taut.\n\n4. Remove kinks from experimental wire
        by pressing the wire between nails of right hand thumb and first finger (through a handkerchief) and moving
        them along the length of the wire.\n\n5. Remove all slotted weights from hanger. Now each wire is equally
        loaded with 1 kg weight.\n\n6. Measure length of experimental wire from tip A to tip B using a metre scale.
        \n\n7. Find the pitch and the least count of the screw gauge.\n\n8. Measure diameter of the experimental wire
        at five different places, equally spaced
    along the length (near two ends, two quarter distance from ends and middle). At each place, measure diameter along
        two mutually perpendicular directions. Record the observations in the table.\n\n9. Note the breaking stress
        for steel from table of constants. Multiply that by the cross section area of the wire to find breaking load
        of the wire. The maximum load is not to exceed one-third of the breaking load.\n\n10. Find the pitch and the
        least count of the spherometer screw attached to frame F1.\n\n11. Adjust the spherometer screw such that the
        bubble in the spirit level is exactly in the centre. Note the reading of the spherometer disc. This reading
        is recorded against zero load.\n\n12. Gently slip a 1/2 kg slotted weight in the hanger and wait for two
        minutes to allow the wire to extend fully. Bubble moves up from the centre.\n\n13. Rotate the spherometer
        screw to bring the bubble back to centre. Note the reading of the spherometer disc. This reading is recorded
        against 1 kg load in load increasing column.\n\n14. Repeat steps 12 and 13 till all the eight 1/2 kg slotted
        weights have been used (now total load on experimental wire is 5 kg which must be one-third of the breaking
        load).\n\n15. Now remove one slotted weight (load decreasing), wait for two minutes to allow the wire to
        contract fully. Bubble moves down from the centre.\n\n16.Repeat step 13. The reading is recorded against load
        in hanger in load decreasing column.\n\n17. Repeat steps 15 and 16 till all the eight slotted weights are
        removed (now load on experimental wire is 1 kg the initial load).
    (Observations for same load in load increasing and in load decreasing column must not differ much. Their mean
        is taken to eliminate the error.)\n\n18. Record your observations as given below.\n </item>
        <item>\t\tThe Young\'s modulus for the material of the wire as determined by Searle\'s
        apparatus, Y = ………………Nm-2\n</item>
        <item>
        1. Both the wires (experimental and auxiliary) should be of same length, material and cross-section.\n\n
        2. Both the wires should be supported from same rigid support.\n\n
        3. Kinks should be removed from experimental wire before starting experiment.\n\n
        4. Diameter of wire should be measured at different places and along two mutually perpendicular directions
        at every place.\n\n
        5. Slotted weights should be added and removed gently.\n\n
        6. Two minutes wait should be made after adding or removing a weight.\n\n
        7. Load should be increased or decreased in regular steps.\n\n
    </item>

        <item>
    1. Experimental wire may not have uniform cross-section throughout.\n\n
    2. The slotted weights may not have standard weight.\n\n
